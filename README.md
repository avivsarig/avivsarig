# Aviv Sarig

👋 Hi, I'm [@avivsarig](https://github.com/avivsarig)!

I used to be a mechanical engineer for almost a decade, but one Covid later - I switched to software development in 2022 and never looked back 👋🏻

Turns out debugging is way faster than rebuilding physical prototypes 😅

On my day-job I'm automating MDM tests at Pure Storage 🤖 and at night I'm building backend services at Belle-AI 💙

📍 Based in Prague, Czech Republic since 2023

The contents of this repo are a hodgepodge of projects - I'm not proud in all of them, and I neglected others earlier than I'd like to.

### Active projects:
- **[Obsidian task automation](https://github.com/avivsarig/Obsidian-backend)** - where I'm trying to automate my productivity flows, and to integrate them with mobile tools like Whatsapp and Google Workplace, to help me create and complete (!) all my tasks, while also serving as a private archive.

### Projects born out of need:
- For my **[FastAPI project Beerpy](https://github.com/avivsarig/beerpy)** I wanted to fetch beer styles according to the Beer Judge Certification Program guidelines from their website, so I wrote **[a parser](https://github.com/avivsarig/BJCP-Guidelines-Parser)** to do that for me.

### Learning experiments:
- **[CerebGo](https://github.com/avivsarig/cerebgo)** - used for time-boxed study time to teach me the basics of Go syntax and concepts.
- **[JanusGate](https://github.com/avivsarig/JanusGate)** - commit-message generator I built to learn about OpenAI API, and its different language models.

### Hiring process artifacts:
- **[TextSimScore](https://github.com/avivsarig/TextSimScore)** - uses Levenshtein distance to tell us if a few strings in an array are suspiciously similar like e.g. spam emails.
- **[Genetic filter/parser](https://github.com/avivsarig/VCFParser)** - for processing genetic variant data for a biotech interview. Provided me with insights about data-hygiene and data-flow performance.

### The rest
Mostly leftovers from past courses I took in the past, and never deleted for some reason.
